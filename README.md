# reactcourse-recipepage

This repo holds the code for a small project in a React course. We students were supposed to include various different elements of React, which makes the code a bit less consistent in "design choices" than would otherwise be the case. Furthermore, I kept the test-files overly commented, keeping links etc. used to aid my own learning of writing unit and integration tests. 

I did not have time to implement my own backend at this time (that was outside the scope of the React course). I do however plan to build another Recipe Page, complete with backend and all, in order to learn the MERN-stack. The plan is to make a complete product for sharing recipes - as well as "events", connecting them to full dinner menus, drink recommendations, photo sharing, ... - within groups of friends!
