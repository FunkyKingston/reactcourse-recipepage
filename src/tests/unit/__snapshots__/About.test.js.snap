      React course!

    <p>
      This first version of the page is for completing a task in a React course. It uses the rich 
      <a
        href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Spoonacular Food API
      </a>
      . Certain elements have been "forced into" the page to satisfy examination criteria. Being a huge food lover with a passion for sharing and having good times together, I actually have loose plans to make a complete recipes page, with the specific focus to share recipes, menus and food-related events among friends. That means designing my own little API, backend, authentication, including functionality for adding recipes, creating menus, etc.
